# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different kickstarter campaigns succeed or fail in relation to their launch dates and their fundraising goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

I started off my analysis by seeing if there is a trend to successful theater kickstarters based on their launch date. I compiled all kickstater campaigns (except for any live campaigns) to find what time of the year seemed to have a higher success rate. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I then wanted to see at what goal range were kickstarter campaigns successful. Building a table with goal ranges and using COUNTIFS for all "plays" to track their trends of successful, failed, and canceled. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenge I ran into was all the manual input for the Goal Range analysis. Making sure that all the data was pointing to the proper source from the “Kickstarter” sheet. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One main conclusion, based on the Launch Date, is that the most successful months to run a Kickstarter are June, July, and August.  After August, the number of successful Kickstarters drop significantly; with the total number of Kickstarters remaining relatively the same. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarters that are under 5000 in cost, have a higher percentage of being successful. After that threshold, Kickstarters become less likely to be successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The main limitation of this dataset is with specific locations. We do have countries, but we do not know if this data is from a single city or different cities in each country. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Using the stack column graph would also be helpful for the “Outcomes Based on Goals” analysis. You could see the difference in the full 100% across all ranges.
